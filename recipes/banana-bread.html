            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this banana bread recipe on hand. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure:<br>
                    <p>2 cups all-purpose flour</p></li>
                <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.<br>
                    <p>1 teaspoon baking soda</p></li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.<br>
                    <p>¼ teaspoon salt</p></li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.<br>
                    <p>½ cup butter</p></li>
                <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.<br>
                    <p>¾ cup brown sugar</p></li>
                <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.<br>
                    <p>2 eggs, beaten</p></li>
                <li><strong>Bananas</strong>: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.<br>
                    <p>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Recipe Directions</h2>
            <p>Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this simple banana bread:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li><br>
